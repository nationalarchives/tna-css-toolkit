The National Archivesâ€™ Digital Services frontend design and development mission is to:

* deliver **high quality**, **inclusive** and **maintainable** digital services, whilst;
* achieving a good balance between **innovation** and **effective use** of our capability;
* and therefore, giving our millions of users an **engaging**, **useful** and **satisfying** experience while using our services.

## 2.0 Principles

### 2.1 User-centred approach

An evidence base approach focusing on the users and their needs at each phase of the design and development life-cycle.

### 2.2 Inclusivity

Technology, infrastructure and systems must be accessible for all users. Accessible design principles; perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.

### 2.3 Progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement provides core content, functionality and compatibility across all browsers and devices to ensure stability.

Ensuring digital assets are reusable, maintainable and scalable.

### 6.2 Commit messages 

We ask that developers contributing to this repository take a considered approach to  their commit messages. We believe a considered commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change and is therefore a vital aspect of good collaboration. A particularly useful resource for understanding this is provided in [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) which outlines the [seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) of a great Git commit message as: 

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
* Use the imperative mood in the subject line
* Wrap the body at 72 characters
* Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. how
